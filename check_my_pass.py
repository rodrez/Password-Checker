    Summary
    -------
    Request the data from the pwned API

    Parameters
    ----------
    query_char : [str]

    Returns
    -------
    [str]
        Response of pwned api given the correct query_char(5 first characters of your sha1 hashed password

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        Ensures the API status code is the correct one.
